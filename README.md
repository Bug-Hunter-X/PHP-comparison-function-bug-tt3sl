# PHP Comparison Function Bug
This repository demonstrates a subtle bug in a simple PHP comparison function. The function `my_function` is intended to return the larger of two input arguments. However, due to a logical error, it unexpectedly always returns the first argument, regardless of which is actually larger. The bug is shown using test cases and the solution is shown to fix the problem.

## Bug
The bug is that the return value of the function is not correct in some instances. The correct return value is obtained in the first two test cases but not in the last test case. 

## Solution
The solution demonstrates how to correct the logical error.
